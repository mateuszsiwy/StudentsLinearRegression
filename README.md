# StudentsLinearRegression

 This project predicts students' final grades based on diverse life factors, utilizing data from the 2014-2015 Portugal high school student performance study.

The objective of this task was to enhance proficiency in data manipulation, towards building a Machine Learning model. I used tools such as: Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn. During the data preparation phase, I checked feature-target correlations to eliminate redundant features and performed encoding of non-numerical features.

I selected Linear Regression for the modelling phase, because it's simplicity. In evaluating the model's performance, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was calculated. When utilizing semestral grades as input, the RMSE was 2.14. When relying only on life factors without prior grades, the RMSE increased to 4.37. It's essential to highlight that the target variable in the dataset exhibited a range from 0 to 20."
